brief: In 2011, Club Med initiated a website overhaul. After having successfully redesigned their “Booking Engine” (conversion funnel), altima° was chosen in 2014 to rebuild the rest of Club Med’s website. I assisted a Senior Project Manager throughout my internship at altima°. My work consisted primarily in the following: 1) the writing of website specifications 2) market research and 3) preparation of UX workshops.

conclusion: Working for Club Med gave me the opportunity to understand how web agencies such as altima° work with big companies on daily and long-term bases. I learned that continuous communication and rigorous organization are key when working with multidisciplinary teams.
