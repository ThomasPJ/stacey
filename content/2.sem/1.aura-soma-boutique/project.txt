brief: Aura Soma is an e-commerce website that sells essential oils and perfumes. My initial work consisted in re-writing all of the website’s product pages. Along with this work, I highlighted several improvements to be made on the website, namely : the installation of a customer feedback system, a better use of social media, and a re-design of the homepage.
-
conclusion: The customer feedback system has become a popular feature and allows customers to comment on their previous purchases and to recommend their purchased goods to other potential clients. Moreover, this system offers a powerful linking feature that pushes my client’s products on other similar websites. Finally, I have a noticed a significantly reduced bounce rate since the re-design of the homepage.
